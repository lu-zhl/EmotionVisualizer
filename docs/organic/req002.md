# Req 002

## Milestone

The name for this milestone is `backend`

## Backend

- I want to use python to build a high performance backend. 
- Please build the local development environment based on docker compose. 
- Please use the local directory to save the database and configurations file, when I reset the containers, I dont' want to lose those assets.
- For the development purposes, we will map the backend project directory into the container, when we change the code, the feature can get updated easily
