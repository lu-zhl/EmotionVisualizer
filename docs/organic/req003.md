## Frontend of Draw my feelings

### Front end style:
- Primary Color Palette: Sky Blue, Light Blue, and White. The design should utilize transitional shades within this range (e.g., #ADD8E6 to #F0F8FF) to create a calm, soothing atmosphere.
- Image Color Limit: Generated images must adhere to a strict color limit of maximum 4 colors per visualization, all with low saturation (muted/pastel tones).
- Image style: Minimalist, clean, and intuitive UI design.
- Shape & Corners: All interactive elements, containers, and buttons must have rounded edges. No sharp corners (90-degree angles) are allowed anywhere in the UI.

### Initial Interface

1- I hope that after opening the App, there is first a cloud-shaped icon(Cloud #0), and the text on it is 'How are you feeling?'

2- After clicking this cloud icon (Cloud #0), two overlapping large cloud icons will appear. 
2.1- The front one (Cloud #1) has an input box on it, where content can be freely entered.
2.2- Behind Cloud #1, a second cloud icon can be seen (Cloud #2). This second cloud can be brought to the front by swiping left, and it has a button on it labeled 'Draw my feelings'. Clicking this button initiates a questionnaire with icons as options.
2.2.1- Level 1 
Title:*'Feel good?'; Single choice.
    Options:'Good / Bad / Not Sure'.
    'Good' and 'Bad' are placed side-by-side in the top row, and 'Not Sure' is centered below.
    Clicking any option proceeds to the second level.
2.2.2- Level 2
Title: 'I feel like:'; Multi selection.
Here, specific emotions are listed based on the previous selection:
If 'Good', only positive emotion icons are listed, e.g., Super happy / Pumped / Cozy / Chill / Content; 
if 'Bad', only negative emotions are listed, e.g., Fuming / Freaked out / Mad as hell / Blah / Down / Bored stiff;
if 'Not Sure', both positive and negative emotions are listed.

3- 'Draw my feelings'
After content in 2.1 or 2.2 is entered, at the very bottom below the Cloud, there is a confirmation button with the text 'Draw my feelings'.
After clicking this button, the mood will be visualized by a Minimalist 2D Cartoon style, and Symmetrical Composition picture.
